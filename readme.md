How To Contribute
==

To contribute by submitting issues; Please submit all issues on Github and be as verbose as possible.

To submit code patches:

- Fork the repository on GitHub.
- Make updates to your code.
- Submit a pull request.

I have decided to go the Pull Request route rather than the open contribution route because I'm still running a hosted version of Nilai.

Enjoy. If you have questions or issues submit them [on GitHub](http://github.com/cdevroe/nilai).

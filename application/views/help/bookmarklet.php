    <h2>Help with bookmarklets</h2>
	<p>Installing bookmarklets isn't easy. Especially on mobile devices. Here is how you do it, step-by-step:</p>

	<h3>On your computer</h3>
	<p>In Safari, Chrome, Firefox, or Internet Explorer the installation process is nearly the same.</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>Click and Drag the link in the sidebar into your browser's bookmarks bar</li>
	  <li>That's it! Now, when you're on a page that you want to bookmark, click the bookmarklet.</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>On iPad, iPhone or iPod touch</h3>

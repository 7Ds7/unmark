			<p>These terms of use are going to change very soon. We're currently working on them. But you know this. And you're OK with that.</p>
			<p>Nilai, as it is being called today, is currently under heavy active development. Features may come and go. We won't use your email address for anything other than letting you know about service updates. And we'll do that rarely. You can use Nilai for free until we've settled on a featureset and that time you'll have the option of upgrading your account, or not. We are not responsible for any data loss during this period but we'll do our very best to not lose even one of your links.</p>

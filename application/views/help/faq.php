    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
	<p>First I'd like to thank everyone that has sent in suggestions and questions. I have a lot of ideas for Nilai but all of yours are welcomed too. I look forward to working together to make Nilai better at helping us with our links. Here are a few of the questions I've gotten more than once.</p>
	
	<h3>How do I send in suggestions?</h3>
	<p>Please tweet all suggestions to <a href="http://twitter.com/nilaico/">@nilaico</a>.</p>
	
	<h3>Will Nilai support custom labels or tags?</h3>
	<p>I think so. Flat taxonomies are sort of a hobby of mine. I'm a tagging freak. But I also know that tags aren't the answer for everything. Tags are messy. Some think thats good. Others do not. I want Nilai to be smart about how links are categorized. I'll talk a lot more about tags in the future. I'm thinking <em>really hard</em> about tags. And I hope to come up with something great. For now, perhaps you can write a #hashtag in a note.</p>
	
	<h3>Are Groups considered "custom labels"?</h3>
	<p>No. Although they surely can be used as such I wouldn't recommend it. Groups are meant to share links between two or more people. At this point I fully intend Nilai to have custom labels so hang in there.</p>
	
	<h3>Do the people I invite to a group have to be a paid-member of Nilai?</h3>
	<p>Yes. In the near future I'll be adding a way to have sponsored accounts - that is, accounts that are paid for by other people or companies. Until then, though, anyone using Nilai has to pay up.</p>
	
	<h3>Will any new labels be added?</h3>
	<p>Yes. The six labels that are currently included in Nilai will not be the only six. If the list should grow it will be because you're demanding it. So please send me a message via Twitter to let me know what labels you'd like to add. Also, custom labels is something I'm currently experimenting with so stay tuned.</p>
	
	<h3>What if I cancel my payment?</h3>
	<p>I'm still working on Nilai's policies. So the following is not written in stone by any means. However, if you choose to stop paying for Nilai I've decided that you should still have access to all of your links forever. You simply will not be able to add more links after the month or year that you've paid for. I will not be issuing any refunds. I hope to make any of Nilai's policies very easy to understand so please stay tuned for an official document.</p>
	
	<h3>Can I edit the title of my links?</h3>
	<p>No. And I don't have it on the roadmap yet to allow that. However, due to the way some links are marked up the title isn't properly saved. I have plans to allow those titles to be edited in the future.</p>
	
	<h3>Nilai looks weird on my iPad 3. What gives?</h3>
	<p>I know. I'm sorry. I don't have an iPad 3 to test with yet. I'll get it fixed up as soon as possible. If you're a developer and have identified the issues please tweet me about them.</p>
	
	<h3>Is there a discussion list?</h3>
	<p>Duane Johnson <a href="https://twitter.com/canadaduane/status/182105266429505537">asked this on Twitter</a> and I'm sure others will think of it so I'll add this to the FAQ too. Is there going to be a place where ideas and features are being considered? Not yet. If any of you have any suggestions or ideas for Nilai please send them to me via Twitter. If you have any suggestions on how we can have a place to discuss these things I'm all ears. I just don't want to waste time managing a forum.</p>
